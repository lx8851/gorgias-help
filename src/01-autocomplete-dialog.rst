Autocomplete Dialog
===================

Automatic dialog helps finding the correct template right there where you type.

Imagine that you have a quicktext that explains to your users that they have to check their spam inbox::

    Title:
        Add note about Spam folder

    Body:
        Note: If you can't find the e-mail, please check your
        'Spam' folder in order to find the missing e-mail.

Now when you hit `CTRL + Space` in the body of your e-mail a small popup
will appear where you can choose the correct template.

You can find the above template by typing `spam` for example. It will match it because it finds it in the title.

.. note:: The `CTRL + Space` keyboard shortcut can be changed in :ref:`options`.


Disabling Autocomplete Dialog
-----------------------------

Autocomplete Dialog is great, but if you want to disable them yo can do so by accessing the extension's :ref:`options`.
